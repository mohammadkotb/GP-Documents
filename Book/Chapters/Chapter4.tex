\subsection{Introduction}
In Chapter 3, the main features used for email classification by Smart Email were introduced. At the end of the chapter, At the end of the chapter, the tuple of the classifier features was presented. This tuple is used as an input for the Smart Email classifier.

In this chapter, project conceptualization and proposed workflow are to be discussed. In section 4.2, project objectives, assumptions and limitations are discussed. Section 4.2 introduces the proposed workflow together with the proposed user stories. In section 4.3, the business requirements are discussed. 

\subsection{Overview}

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Project Objectives}
The business objectives of this project are listed below. Delivering these 
objectives will deliver the expected benefits of the application.
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item Automatically organizing congested and uncategorized emails into folders.
  \item Summarizing long email threads into a brief summary describing the 
	main points in these threads.
\end{my_itemize}


%==============================================================================

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Some assumptions generally must be made in order to write a succinct definition 
of the application. Some assumptions are technical, while others are business natured.  Assumptions 
critical to the success of this project are listed below:
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item each user will have his own trained classification and summarization 
	models based on the user supplied training data;
  \item a web service will be implemented to provide email 
	classification and summarization support for different mail 
	servers (Example: Google, Hotmail, Yahoo);
  \item english language will be supported by default;
  \item email summarization will be provided as an on-demand service by the application user;
  \item the servers providing the web service have to provide sufficient 
	processing power for achieving reasonable response time;
  \item email classification will be based on the email subject and content. 
	Other features can be used as well, such as the email sender and recepient(s). 
	However, email attachments will not be considered as a classification feature for the email.
\end{my_itemize}

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Limitations}
Some limitations are assumptions on the extent of feature scope. Others are restrictions on resources 
or methods for achieving the objectives. The limitations of this project are listed below:

\begin{my_itemize}
  \item sufficient number of emails is needed for each email label to achieve 
	a reasonable classification accuracy;
  \item emails with size less than a specified threshold cannot be summarized.
\end{my_itemize}

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Open items and Risks}
During the conceptualization of the project and in the process of writing this document, 
some issues remain open.
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item Multi-label classification.
  \item Arabic support.
  \item The need for a client side application to assist the server side.
  \item Online training for classification models.
  \item Specifications for the web server providing the web service.
\end{my_itemize}

\subsubsection{High Level Workflow}
The workflow required to complete the primary objectives of the proposed 
application is described below. The workflow is business-centered, and 
includes ``decision forks'' for decisions the business user, or application, 
must make to achieve the objective. The workflow omits application faults or exceptions. 
Individual tasks in the workflow are described.

\includegraphics[width=13cm]{workflow_process_map.png}
  \caption[Workflow Process] {Workflow Process}
\end{figure}

  \item Workflow Description
  \begin{my_itemize}
    \item Incoming Emails are preprocessed.
    \item Summarization module checks that email length is greater than a predefined threshold:
    \begin{my_itemize}
      \item if the length is greater than the threshold, the email is fed to the 
	    summarizer which outputs the summary;
      \item short emails are returned without summarization.
    \end{my_itemize}
    \item Classification module uses the user model to classify the email into a specific label.
    \item The result is returned by the web service.
  \end{my_itemize}
\end{my_enumerate}

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{User stories}
Breaking up the system components to user stories with estimated time (in terms
of man-days = 4 hours) to finish the story is very good practice.

\subsection{Business Requirements}

This section identifies, enumerates and explores the business requirements that must 
be met by the application. Business requirements include capturing the types of users, 
the basic inputs and outputs, the system's dependencies, and the tasks the system should 
accomplish. It is important to confirm that Task Requirements include all the tasks 
required to meet the business objectives.

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Users}
All applications have users and most have several users of different types. This 
section identifies, at a high level, the types of users of the system.

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item Application User: requests emails' classification and summarization.
  \item Admin: tunes classification and summarization algorithms and observes the results.
\end{my_enumerate}

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Inputs/Outputs}
This section identifies and describes the inputs to and outputs from the new 
application. Inputs can include electronic inputs, like RSS and EDI feeds, 
updates from external databases, etc, as well as human inputs, like 
``user X keys in results from report Y.'' Output can include electronic feeds, 
printed reports, ...etc. In this section, all electronic inputs and outputs 
are captured. Human inputs are omitted from this section.

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item Inputs:
  \begin{my_itemize}
    \item unclassified Emails;
    \item classified Emails (training data);
    \item email Threads.

%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Dependencies}
Human inputs are also categorized as dependencies. List all dependencies.

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item Registeration data.
  \item Request for summarizing an email thread.
\end{my_enumerate}


%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
This section documents, at a high level, the basic security requirements of the 
application. For example, does the system require the user to log in?  Should the 
user’s identity be authenticated on just this system, or against a central authority?  
Are there any special or unusual security requirements, like fingerprint scanning?

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item The system requires every user to log in with a unique identity (email).
  \item User Data (email) should be transmitted through a secure connection.
  \item Administrators shouldn’t have access to user data (email).
\end{my_enumerate}



%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}
Performance Requirements for the application are defined at a high level below. 
If there are specific requirements for specific features to perform at a quantifiable 
level, they too are listed below. These requirements will be developed in more detail when 
the Requirements Specification is written, in a later phase.

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item Web service should respond within a reasonable time.
  \item Initial training phase should finish within a reasonable time.
  \item The system will achieve high uptime.
\end{my_enumerate}


%==============================================================================
\subsubsection{Data Migration}
Data Migration describes the data that needs to be moved from an older or external 
system to the new system, in order for it to operate at launch. Migration also includes 
data that must be transferred from the new system to another external system. 
Any data migration requirements are listed below.

\begin{my_enumerate}
  \item Users' classified emails for training phase as pre-classified emails are needed to build users' models.
  \item Users' email threads which needed to be summarized.
\end{my_enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}

%==============================================================================

\section{Software Design Description (SDD)}

\subsection{Introduction}
In Chapter 4, the project conceptualization was introduced as well as the 
proposed workflow and business requirements.

In this chapter, system architecture, main components and their functionalities, 
and how different components interaction is to be discussed in section 5.3. 
In section 5.4, the module interface for each component will be introduced.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Overview}

\subsubsection{Purpose}
This chapter shows how the smart email software system will be 
structured to satisfy the requirements identified in the conceptual 
design document and software requirements specification. It is 
a translation of requirements into a description of the software
structure, software components, interfaces, and data necessary for 
the implementation phase.

\subsubsection{Scope}
Smart email will provide automated email classification and foldering 
service for email clients. This chapter describes how the system will 
be divided into modules and the design details for each module.


\subsection{Decomposition description}
This project is designed using an incremental approach. There are two
primary  stages to the design development which consists of Phase 1 
(Classification Web Service Module) and Phase 2 (Email Monitoring Web Service Module).

The classification module can be divided into three layers. The data layer will be 
responsible for retrieving emails from file systems or using IMAP protocol. The 
second layer is the preprocessing and email filtering layer. This layer is 
responsible for filtering emails and extracting classification features from the 
email. The third and last layer will be responsible for classifying emails and 
testing the classifier performance.

The detailed design for each design entity is illustrated in the detailed class 
diagram at the end of this chapter.

\subsubsection{System decomposition}
The system is divided into main modules as follows:
\begin{my_itemize}
