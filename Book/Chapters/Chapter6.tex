To better understand the individual contributions of each feature used for email classification to the overall effectiveness of the classifier, we next present an analysis of the ability of each to capture information and its effect on the overall accuracy of the classifier.

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using boolean attributes with NaiveBayes is better than using numeric attributes.
\item Using numeric attributes with SVM is better than using boolean attributes.
\item SVM outperforms NaiveBayes in almost all the cases.
\item Classification using the sender feature alone yields good results.
\item Best combination so far is using the sender feature along with the WordFrequency feature
\end{itemize}

Finally, formal tests and experiments will be conducted where more features and different combinations will be used. Also tuning the parameters of feature has a good impact on the results, so more experiments to select the best tunings should be carried out for each feature.
