\section{Introduction}
In Chapter 4, the project conceptualization was introduced as well as the 
proposed workflow and business requirements.

In this chapter, system architecture, main components and their functionalities, 
and how different components interaction is to be discussed in section 5.3. 
In section 5.4, the module interface for each component will be introduced.

\section{Overview}

\subsection{Purpose}
This chapter shows how the smart email software system will be 
structured to satisfy the requirements identified in the conceptual 
design document and software requirements specification. It is 
a translation of requirements into a description of the software
structure, software components, interfaces, and data necessary for 
the implementation phase.

\subsection{Scope}
Smart email will provide automated email classification and foldering 
service for email clients. This chapter describes how the system will 
be divided into modules and the design details for each module.


\section{Decomposition description}
This project is designed using an incremental approach. There are two
primary  stages to the design development which consists of Phase 1 
(Classification Web Service Module) and Phase 2 (Email Monitoring Web Service Module).

The classification module can be divided into three layers. The data layer will be 
responsible for retrieving emails from file systems or using IMAP protocol. The 
second layer is the preprocessing and email filtering layer. This layer is 
responsible for filtering emails and extracting classification features from the 
email. The third and last layer will be responsible for classifying emails and 
testing the classifier performance.

The detailed design for each design entity is illustrated in the detailed class 
diagram at the end of this chapter.

\subsection{System decomposition}
The system is divided into main modules as follows:
\begin{my_itemize}
\item classification web service module;
\item email monitoring web service moudle.
\end{my_itemize}
Each of these modules will be described in details in the upcoming subsections.

\subsubsection{Email Monitoring Web Service Module}

Email Monitoring Web Service is a web service implemented in rails framework which integrates 
with a classification web service for classification of emails. The web service monitors 
users emails and sends every new email to the classification service through a rest API 
which returns a response with the email label, the web service then applies  the label to the userâ€™s email.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Features
 \begin{itemize}
    \item Users registrations.
    \item Adding more than email account.
    \item Continuous monitoring of emails accounts for new emails.
    \item Providing statistics about the classification process.
 \end{itemize}
 \item Future Work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Support providers other than Gmail: Yahoo, Hotmail, ...etc.
    \item Classifying users into active and non-active ones based on 
	  their email account activity to decrease the load and increase 
	  the performance of the monitoring process.
    \item Increasing performance and security.
    \item Authenticating gmail accounts using Oauth.
  \end{itemize}


\end{itemize}

	\begin{my_itemize}
	\item makeFeatureInstance(Email email): creates a feature instance from the given email.
