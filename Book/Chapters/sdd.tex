\section{Introduction}

This software design description document is a model of the smart email software system to be created. The model provides the precise design information needed for planning, analysis, and implementation of the software system. The document represents a partitioning of the system into design entities and describe the important properties and relationships among those entities.

\subsection{Purpose}
This SDD document shows how the smart email software system will be structured to satisfy the requirements identiﬁed in the conceptual design document and software requirements speciﬁcation. It is a translation of requirements into a description of the software
structure, software components, interfaces, and data necessary for the implementation phase. This SDD is a detailed blueprint for the implementation activity.

\subsection{Scope}
This software design document provides the design details of smart email. Smart email will provide automated email classification and summarization service. This document describes how the system will be divided into modules and the design details for each module.

\section{Decomposition description}
This project is being designed using an incremental approach. There are three primary 
stages to the design development which consists of Phase 1 (Classification Module), 
due March 1, 2012, Phase 2 (Summarization Module), due the week of April 1, 2012 
and Phase 3 (Web Service Module), due the week of May 1, 2012.

The classification module can be divided into three layers. The data layer will be 
responsible for retrieving emails from file systems or using IMAP protocol. The 
second layer is the preprocessing and email filtering layer. This layer is 
responsible for filtering emails and extracting classification features from the 
email. The third and last layer will be responsible for classifying emails and 
testing the classifier performance.

The detailed design for each design entity is illustrated in the detailed class 
diagram attached with this SDD document.
