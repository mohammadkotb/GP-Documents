\section{Conclusion}
In chapter 1, the project's main idea was illustrated which
is a web service that provides automatic email categorization into
user-defined folders based on machine learning and data mining
classification techniques.

A classification web service was built with REST API \cite{REST} that receives
classification requests with the required email to be classified and returns
the most suitable category for this mail.

An Email monitoring web service was built as a client for the classification
web service mentioned above. Users can register in this web servers to have
their email accounts continuously monitored and their incoming emails automatically
classified to the best category.

A Google Chrome Browser \cite{CHROME} Extension was built as another example of a
classification web service client. The Extension provides google chrome users
with a graphical user interface that is integrated with gmail web interface.
Using this extension , Users can send email classification requests on demand.
The extension also detects manual classification done by the user to be sent
for the classification web service as a feedback on the classifier to learn
from the users classification pattern.
