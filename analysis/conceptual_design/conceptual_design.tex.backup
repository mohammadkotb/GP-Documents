\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview Application}
Email has been an efficient and popular communication mechanism as the number 
of Internet users increases. Therefore, email management has become an important 
and growing problem for individuals and organizations because it is prone to misuse.

One of the problems that are most important is disordered email messages, 
congested and unstructured emails in mail boxes. It may be very hard to 
find archived email messages, search for previous emails with specified contents 
or features when the mails are not well structured and organized. Email 
summarization is another important and challenging problem.

Smart Email is an application addressing these problems by providing automatic 
email summarization and categorization into folders.

\subsection{Project Objectives}
The business objectives of this project are listed below. Delivering these 
objectives will deliver the expected benefits of the application.
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item Automatically organizing congested and uncategorized emails into folders.
  \item Summarizing lengthy email threads into a brief summary describing the 
	main points in these threads.
\end{my_itemize}


%==============================================================================
\subsection{Assumptions}
Some assumptions generally must be made in order to write a succinct definition 
of the application. Some assumptions are technical (e.g. ``the new system will 
employ a normalized database schema''), while others are business natured (e.g. 
``the client will provide an enterprise Oracle environment'').  Assumptions 
critical to the success of this project are listed below:
