\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview Application}
Email has been an efficient and popular communication mechanism as the number 
of Internet users increases. Therefore, email management has become an important 
and growing problem for individuals and organizations because it is prone to misuse.

One of the problems that are most important is disordered email messages, 
congested and unstructured emails in mail boxes. It may be very hard to 
find archived email messages, search for previous emails with specified contents 
or features when the mails are not well structured and organized. Email 
summarization is another important and challenging problem.

Smart Email is an application addressing these problems by providing automatic 
email summarization and categorization into folders.

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Project Objectives}
The business objectives of this project are listed below. Delivering these 
objectives will deliver the expected benefits of the application.
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item Automatically organizing congested and uncategorized emails into folders.
  \item Summarizing lengthy email threads into a brief summary describing the 
	main points in these threads.
\end{my_itemize}


%==============================================================================
\subsection{Assumptions}
Some assumptions generally must be made in order to write a succinct definition 
of the application. Some assumptions are technical (e.g. ``the new system will 
employ a normalized database schema''), while others are business natured (e.g. 
``the client will provide an enterprise Oracle environment'').  Assumptions 
critical to the success of this project are listed below:
\begin{my_itemize}
  \item each user will have his own trained classification and summarization 
	models based on the user supplied training data;
  \item a web service will be implemented to provide email 
	classification and summarization support for different mail 
	servers (Example: Google, Hotmail, Yahoo);
  \item english language will be supported by default;
  \item email summarization will be provided as on-demand service by the application user;
  \item the servers providing the web service have to provide sufficient 
	processing power for achieving reasonable response time;
  \item email classification will be based on the email subject and content. 
	Other features can be used as well, such as the email sender and receiver. 
	However, email attachment will not be considered as a classification feature for the email.
\end{my_itemize}

%==============================================================================
\subsection{Limitations}
Every project has limitations on the scope of the problem it attempts to solve, 
on the capabilities of the implementation technology, ...etc. Some limitations 
are assumptions on the extent of feature scope. Others are restrictions on resources 
or methods for achieving the objectives. The limitations of this project are listed below:

\begin{my_itemize}
  \item sufficient number of emails is needed for each email category to achieve a reasonable classification accuracy;
  \item emails with size less than a specified threshold will not be summarized.
\end{my_itemize}
